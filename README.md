# WebScrapping-Flipkart-Refridgerator-Analysis
🧊 Flipkart Refrigerator Data Analysis using Web Scraping
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on extracting refrigerator product data from Flipkart using web scraping techniques and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand pricing trends, product features, and customer preferences.

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world data analyst task — collecting raw data from a website, cleaning it, and generating meaningful business insights.

🎯 Objectives

Scrape refrigerator product data from Flipkart

Clean and preprocess raw scraped data

Analyze price patterns and feature trends

Identify popular brands and configurations

Visualize insights using charts and graphs

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

BeautifulSoup – for web scraping

Requests – for sending HTTP requests

Pandas – for data manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset was created by scraping Flipkart and includes the following features:

Column Name	Description
Brand	Refrigerator brand name
Capacity	Storage capacity (in Liters)
Doors	Number of doors
Star Rating	Energy efficiency rating
Ratings	Customer rating score

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Web Scraping

Sent requests to Flipkart product pages

Parsed HTML using BeautifulSoup

Extracted product details such as brand, price, capacity, ratings, etc.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed null and duplicate values

Converted price to numeric format

Standardized column formats

Handled missing values

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Price distribution analysis

Brand-wise price comparison

Energy rating vs price analysis

Door type popularity

Capacity trend analysis

4️⃣ Data Visualization

Used graphs to understand:

Most common refrigerator types

Relationship between star rating and price

Popular brands in different price ranges

📊 Key Insights

Certain brands dominate the mid-price segment

Higher star ratings generally lead to higher prices

Double-door refrigerators are among the most common

Larger capacity refrigerators are priced significantly higher
